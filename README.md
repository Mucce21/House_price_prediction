# House_price_prediction
California housing prices using machine learning

Goal- The goal of this project was to predict housing prices in the California area using machine learning.

Steps- 
1.Loading the dataset
2.Explore the data
3.Process and train the data (x_train, y_train), divide the data to train and test splits
4.Feature engineering
5.Linear regression model to train and test result
6.Random forest model to train and test result

Findings- With Random forest model we got a 97% accuracy when we changed the n_estimator to 30 and the max_features 8
